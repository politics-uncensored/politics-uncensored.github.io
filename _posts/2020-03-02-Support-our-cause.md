Currently we are all censored on our channel by freenode. We will remain connected as an act of loyalty to the channel and to freedom of speech and as a form of demonstration on how many people would like to talk and are censored.

Everyone who supports our cause please join our channel as a way of supporting us even if you can't speak.

I will try to reverse this unjust measure. In the meantime for everyone who wants to talk about politics there is #politics-uncensored on irc.rizon.net
