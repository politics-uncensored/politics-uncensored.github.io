# Welcome to ##Politics-Uncensored

A U.S.-centric political discussion channel founded on August 7 2016. We encourage constructive dialogue and rigorous debate but maintain standards of respect, common values, and decency.

## 2. Mission Statement

Politics impact every aspect of our lives and is a natural topic of discussion in a text chat forum such as IRC. Unfortunately due to their tendency to become acrimonious, political discussions are often considered off-topic and unwelcome in other channels on this network.

While other political discussion channels exist, they tend to employ what we consider heavy-handed moderation tactics which appear intended to promote and reinforce a certain political agenda. This results in a one-sided discussion and suppression of alternative or non-mainstream opinions and viewpoints.

Our mission in creating ##Politics-Uncensored is to provide an open forum where users can discuss political topics and controversial subjects without fear of the perennially over-used ban hammer so readily wielded in other channels. We hope to foster interesting, engaging, enlightening conversations about politics, history, morality, and other subjects without yielding to our more base instincts of territoriality and cynicism.

Please help us promote free and open dialogue in a healthy and constructive manner.

## 3. Guidelines

1. ðŸ†˜ Uncensored does not mean unmoderated or "anything goes".
2. ðŸ†˜ Uncensored in our context means no arbitrary suppression of legitimate political expression and discussion.
3. The channel should be a place where everybody can feel comfortable expressing their viewpoints on political topics.
4. All participants are expected to remain civil and respect other people and their opinions whether they agree or not.
5. At no time are you permitted to be rude, judgmental, or belittling.
6. No specific word(s) is/are banned from usage but gratuitous use of uncivil or offensive words in any language are unwelcome. This channel is not a sailor pub and language is expected to reflect such behavior as presumed in polite company.
7. Do not accuse, provoke or intentionally offend others, solicit violence or retribution, or engage in personal attacks.
8. Do not discuss or taunt users who have been removed, kicked, banned, quieted or devoiced.
9. All drama related to any other channel on this network is unwelcome in ##Politics-Uncensored.
10. Likewise, do not allow your political discussions from ##Politics-Uncensored to spill over to other channels on this network.

2. ðŸ†˜ Sexuality, potentially illegal activities and the like are unwelcome. These topics are not banned, but should be approached responsibly; stating your position is valid, but trolling, baiting, hostility or repetition are not.

## 6. Operator Actions

1. We employ an `@iban` system to discourage unhelpful contributions to channel discussions and a Doge Wallet system to positively reinforce valuable contribution to channel discussions.
2. An `@iban` is issued as a ban, but functions as a `+q` or quiet.  The user is still permitted to be present in channel, but is simply unable to contribute to the conversation for a period of time.  The user is effectively "put in the corner" to think about what they've said and, the manner in which they've expressed it.
3. If you receive an `@iban` moderation action, please note the numerical limit of the action.  The number is representative of seconds, so `@iban` value of 120 is only a two-minute quiet.  There is no need to "ragequit" for a simple/short `@iban` ; simply compose yourself and defend your position in a more civilized manner.
4. Respect decisions by channel and server staff and do not disrupt the channel.  If you disagree with an operator action please discuss privately with the operator in PM.  However, please note that you are not entitled to any response under any circumstances and repeated harassment will only lengthen your participation restriction.

## 7. Operator/Moderator rules

1. Any user may be granted Moderation Privileges (`+oO`) regardless of political affiliation.
2. Users are granted moderation privileges based upon their demonstrated ability to maintain impartiality.
3. If you are a trusted moderator (granted `+oO` or any variation thereof), you are expected to enforce freenodeâ„¢ Terms of Service without regard for personal considerations.
4. "Revenge Moderation" is not tolerated.  If you kick/ban/moderate a user, be sure you can justify your actions
or risk losing `+o`.  We will not tolerate moderator actions for petty revenge.
5. If at any time you become unwilling or unable to enforce freenodeâ„¢ ToS, you may request to be excused from moderation duties without consequence.
6. Abuse of moderator privileges will result in summary loss of moderation abilities without recourse.
7. Channel moderators shall not air grievances in channel.
8. Channel moderators shall not reverse decisions by other moderators without consensus. Those who have a disagreement should discuss their reasoning & objections with one another in PM and come to a consensus.
9. In all moderation cases where disagreements may arise, Commander decisions will stand until reviewed by Captain.

## 9. Caveats

### @godwin

Godwin's law is an Internet adage which asserts that "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches". ##Politics-Uncensored has adopted this debate rule so that once such a comparison is made, the debate is finished and whoever mentioned Hitler has automatically lost whatever debate was in progress.
 
### @noway

A ##Politics-Uncensored Caveat which (once invoked), is equivalent to throwing down or calling out an incredulous assertion. Once No Way has been invoked, failure to provide definitive proof of assertion results in immediate dismissal of same.
 
### @bribe

1. (n) Money or any other valuable consideration given or promised with a view to corrupting the behavior of a person., or
2. Gleefully accepted by channel Captain and Commander. (Only applicable to these two Sr. Staff positions in perpetuity.)
3. Special consideration bribes have a mandatory minimum of 1 million doge.

### @pyramid

Please consider raising the quality of the discussion by climbing up the [pyramid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Graham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement.svg)
